XXXXXXXX deinvert y

-- the rest of the text sizing cases

-- the advanced stack cases like SpaceEvenly or whatever 

XXXXXXXX the entire typed keys thing.

-- images:
  - renderer (muh bindless)
  - Size::ImageContent
  - loading them from images, at compile time and runtime

-- custom render rects

-- put the textareas in a slotmap or slab

-- Expose the cosmic_text buffer and make sure it's not too crazy. remember about the align trick

-- better text edit:
  - cursor
  - ctrl + z
  - mouse select
  - multiline text edit is NOT happening in the current decade.

-- make peace with cosmic_text and glyphon.
  - glyphon: we just added the last_frame skip thing, I think.
    there should be plenty of other ways to do it, maybe that Iterator argument thing.
  - cosmic_text: probably impossible. I need that stupid string to be public for the single_line_text_edit.

-- that thing about the siblings or subtrees or whatever

-- skipping rendering, skipping layout, partial layout...

-- scrolling
-- virtual lists or something


Optional stuff:

- vertex pulling or whatever. conflicting info about whether it should be faster or not. https://www.yosoygames.com.ar/wp/2018/03/vertex-formats-part-2-fetch-vs-pull/

- compress the rect vertex data

- magic translations

- ninepatchrects and textures...

- muh mspaint

- some random widgets

- Size::AspectRatio?
